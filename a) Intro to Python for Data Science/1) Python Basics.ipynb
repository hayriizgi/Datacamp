    "Calculator logic applies for Python for any operation. If you type in Shell, it will give the answer directly. If you type it in Script (.py), then you need to capsulate it in <b>print()</b> command.\n",

    "* Exponentiation (******): This operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right. For example 4 ** 2 will give 16.\n",
